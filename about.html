    Hi there! Welcome to my Blog (:
</p>

<p>
    My name is Kátia Nakamura and I'm from Brazil - born and raised.
</p>

<p>
    I received a master's degree in Computer Science (Operational Research) at <a href="http://www.unifesp.br/">Federal University of São Paulo</a>. During my bachelor's degree - also in CS - I got an ERASMUS MUNDUS Scholarship to study abroad for one year at the Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic (from 2010 and 2011).
</p>

<p>
    During my master's degree I had an opportunity to be Research Assistant at Laval University in Quebec City, Canada for 3 months. As a result of the research my article <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41274-017-0205-8">"The Traveling Backpacker Problem: A computational comparison of two formulations"</a> was published by the Journal of the Operational Research Society.
</p>

<p>
    Currently I'm based in Brno, Czech Republic working as Tech Team Lead at <a href="https://www.kiwi.com/">Kiwi.com</a>.
